# RecipeBox

RecipeBox is an iOS and web application that helps the user save their favorite recipes in one place from anywhere on the web. That is just the beginning though, and there is so much you can do with this brilliant app.

This project was created by one of my mentors. It is a closed source project so I cannot share too many details. I can say that I have implemented features to the production web version of the application.
